## 09.10-09.11, 9.20-9.22, 9.30-X

Ran full script of `run_aaamodel-65yo_scen1.R` with 100,000 people and parallel. However, this evidently is still too few people, looking at the results.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

pd.read_csv('tab2_100k.csv')
```

I pulled changes to files and renv onto remote computer, and then ran that with 1,000,000 people.
