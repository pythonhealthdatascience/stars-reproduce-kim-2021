## 09.12-09.19, 09.22-09.24: Get aorta sizes from AAA deaths in surv scenario 0

Create a script `functions/extra_functions.R` and moved the function I created yesterday - `get_aaa_death_aorta_sizes()` - from `run_aaamodel_surv_scen1.R` to `extra_functions.R`. This is so that:

1. It sits alongside other model functions
2. It can be used in scenario 0 and scenario 1 without duplication

I test ran it on a small sample before setting it to run on a remote machine.

Timings:

* Full run (one scenario): 4.633 minutes = 278 seconds = 4 minutes 38 seconds

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 741

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.12', '09.19'),
    ('09.22', '09.24')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
