TBC. Total time used: TBCh TBCm (TBC%).

## 09.09-09.43: Resuming supplementary table 2

Combined each scenario with scenario 0, then adapted previous functions to generate the table.

Consider this reproduced at 09.43.

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 805

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.09', '09.43')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```

## 10.02-10.38: Supplementary figure 3

Amend prior functions to combine with scenario 0 using a function (as repeated lots, and need again for this figure). Could then use those dataframes in my figure functions.

Consider this reproduced at 10.38.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 805

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.09', '09.43'),
    ('10.02', '10.38')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
