## 10.05-10.12: Consensus on reproduction

This was not done previously as Tom had three weeks annual leave (two weeks + one week where I was also). Checked each item today, and Tom confirmed he was happy these were reproduced.

We spent a little while considering in-text result 1, as the percentages look a bit different, but decided this was a minor concern as the absolute values matched up, and looking at it as a whole, we aren't concerned by this and feel it is all reasonably close enough to be successfully reproduced.

Note: Included in overall reproduction time, but not time to each item in scope, so time to final item in scope will be a little less than this overall recorded time.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 875

# Times from today
times = [
    ('10.05', '10.12')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
