Test-run and archiving.

:::

## Untimed: Test-run

Tom performed a test-run on XPS13 with Ubuntu 22.04. He found that:

* `renv`: built fine
* `testthat`: ran correctly (instantly)
* Tried running `run_aaamodel)_65yo_scen0.R` - initially didn't work as was doing `run()`, but when switched to `source()` it did work although took a while on his machine

## Untimed: Wrapping up

Now that is complete, I emailed the authors to let them know, and set a new release to send a new version of the repository to be archived on zenodo.
