## 09.12-09.16: Run surv scenario 2

Update renv on remote machine, and then set surv scen2 to run.

Timings:

* First run: 14.850 minutes
* All runs:

## 09.20-09.58: Figure 2

Fixed dimensions of Figure 1 so it doesn't change each time I re-run with different window widths. Then resumed work on Figure 2, adapting Figure 1 code to create functions that can be used to produce both plots.

Satisfied this is reproduced at 09.58.

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 539

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.12', '09.16'),
    ('09.20', '09.58')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```

## Timings

```{python}
import sys

from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 539

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.12', '09.16'),
    ('09.20', '09.58')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
