## 09.38-09.43: High entropy secret

Upload of code to repository triggered a notification from GitGuardian for upload of a high entropy secret. Opening the GitGuardian dashboard, I found the source of this issue was an API key uploaded to `original_study/AAA_DES_model/input/NAAASP_Men_2020-05-11/DES_Data_Input_NAAASP_Men_30years_time_horizon_2020-05-11.R` on line 376:

`# SOURCE: Love-Koh 2015 (https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1098301515018471?token=AB11057F469D57EBE990778CCDC883E9D35D3CFD83AD143352F3AD497E822198F957DBCE2EA86AE6DC16F2F6CE350409)`

This is not a concern - the link doesn't work with that token for others.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 32

# Times from today
times = [
    ('', '')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
