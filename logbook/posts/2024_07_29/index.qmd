## 09.38-09.43: High entropy secret

Upload of code to repository triggered a notification from GitGuardian for upload of a high entropy secret. Opening the GitGuardian dashboard, I found the source of this issue was an API key uploaded to `original_study/AAA_DES_model/input/NAAASP_Men_2020-05-11/DES_Data_Input_NAAASP_Men_30years_time_horizon_2020-05-11.R` on line 376:

`# SOURCE: Love-Koh 2015 (https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1098301515018471?token=AB11057F469D57EBE990778CCDC883E9D35D3CFD83AD143352F3AD497E822198F957DBCE2EA86AE6DC16F2F6CE350409)`

This is not a concern - the link doesn't work with that token for others.

The DOI for this article is <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2015.03.1784>.

## 09.53-09.55: Correct file paths

For `study_publication.qmd`.

## 10.05-10.15, 10.29-10.45: Read journal article

Uses a previously developed and validated model described in:

* Glover MJ, Jones E, Masconi KL, Sweeting MJ, Thompson SG. Discrete Event Simulation for Decision Modeling in Health Care: Lessons from Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening. Med Decis Making. 2018; 38(4):439–51. <https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X17753380> PMID: 31665967
* Thompson SG, Bown MJ, Glover MJ, Jones E, Masconi KL, Michaels JA, et al. Screening women aged 65 years or over for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a modelling study and health economic evaluation. Health Technol Assess. 2018; 22(43):1–142. <https://doi.org/10.3310/hta22430> PMID: 30132754

Some notes on scope (beyond obvious tables/figures):

* In-text result for `Surveillance cohort: Scan suspension` (re: breakdown of deaths by type) are not captured in tables/figures
* Supplementary figure 1 and 2 are more like methods than results? Are referenced in methods.
* In-text results for `Surveillance cohort: Drop-out` are captured in Table 3 and Figure 4
* Also captured are `Surveillance cohort: Threshold for surgery`
* Supplementary figure 3 and supplementary table 2 are definitely in scope

## 10.46-11.02: Define scope for reproduction

I described my interpretation of scope within `scope.qmd`.

## 11.09-11.13: Discussed scope with Tom

Looked over and happy with scope. He then did another look over the paper, but confirmed no further items.

## 11.26-X: Archive scope

Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `CITATION.cff`, set up sync on Zenodo, then created a Git release.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 32

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.38', '09.43'),
    ('09.53', '09.55'),
    ('10.05', '10.15'),
    ('10.29', '10.45'),
    ('10.46', '11.02'),
    ('11.09', '11.13')]
# TODO: Finish adding times

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
