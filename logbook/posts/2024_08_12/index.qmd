Working on research compendium stage.

## Untimed: Summary report

Add required troubleshooting steps to summary report

## Untimed: Research compendium

* **Have seperate folders for data, methods and outputs** - have decided there is no need to reorganise - although it is not exactly those three folder names, it does have those different files seperated out
* **Run times** - already recorded
* **README** - filled out the README for the `reproduction/` folder (*currently partially complete*)
* **Tests** - due to the high run time of these scenarios, I created a very minimal test example. This used 65 yo scenario 0 but with 1e3 people (instead of 1e6), and so the test runs in only 5 seconds. This serves as a basic indicator of whether someone's model is running and producing results as expected on a new machine, but is in no way comprehensive.
