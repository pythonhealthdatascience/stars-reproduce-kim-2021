::: {.callout-note}

Working on research compendium stage (which inc. troubleshooting some issues with running the model which arose while working on tests).

:::

## Untimed: Summary report

Add required troubleshooting steps to summary report

## Untimed: Research compendium

### Initial steps

**Have seperate folders for data, methods and outputs** - have decided there is no need to reorganise - although it is not exactly those three folder names, it does have those different files seperated out

**README** - filled out the README for the `reproduction/` folder (*currently partially complete*)

**Tests** - due to the high run time of these scenarios, I created a very minimal test example. This used 65 yo scenario 0 but with 1e3 people (instead of 1e6), and so the test runs in only 5 seconds. This serves as a basic indicator of whether someone's model is running and producing results as expected on a new machine, but is in no way comprehensive.

**Dockerfile** - based on my file from [Huang et al. 2019](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-reproduce-huang-2019/blob/main/reproduction/docker/Dockerfile). I create and launched a container by running:
  * `sudo docker build --tag kim2021 . -f ./reproduction/docker/Dockerfile`
  * `(sleep 2 && xdg-open http://localhost:8888) & sudo docker run -it -p 8888:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true --name kim2021_docker kim2021`

### Troubleshooting tests

I then ran the test (`testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")`) in the docker container. However, it returned an error:

```
Error in `1:v0$numberOfPersons`: argument of length 0
Backtrace:
    ▆
 1. └─global Eventsandcosts(scen0.invite) at test-model.R:50:3
 2.   ├─base::unlist(...) at functions/DES_Model.R:1684:5
 3.   └─base::sapply(...) at functions/DES_Model.R:1684:5
 4.     └─base::lapply(X = X, FUN = FUN, ...)
```

I tried changing the number of people (`1e4`), and then the seed (`3210` to `999`), but the issue persisted within the docker container.

Looking at the variable v0, on the container it becomes:

```
generateCensoringTime = 
function() { 30.000001 }
<bytecode: 0x59655b5310c8>
```

However, when running tests on my machine, its value is:

```
generateCensoringTime = 
function() { 30.000001 }
<bytecode: 0x652354295330>
treatmentGroups = screening 
returnEventHistories = TRUE 
returnAllPersonsQuantities = FALSE 
method = serial 
numberOfPersons = 1000 
randomSeed = 3210 
```

I tried clearing the environment on my machine and re-running the test, and it returned the same issue - and so it seems the issue is unrelated to docker, but instead was unnoticed prior as I hadn't cleared my environment.

Printing `v0` during the test, I can see it is set up correctly. I add the original print statements from the scenario script and then found I got a different error:

```
<subscriptOutOfBoundsError/error/condition>
Error in `result$eventHistories[[i]]`: subscript out of bounds
Backtrace:
    ▆
 1. └─global Eventsandcosts(scen0.invite) at test-model.R:58:3
 2.   ├─base::unlist(...) at functions/DES_Model.R:1684:5
 3.   └─base::sapply(...) at functions/DES_Model.R:1684:5
 4.     └─base::lapply(X = X, FUN = FUN, ...)
 5.       └─FUN(X[[i]], ...)
```

I checked the code matched the original, and tried tweaking little bits and bobs, but found the error persisted.

I tried adding a print statement for components going into the formula, where the error is occuring, in `DES_Model.R` -

```
print(v0$numberOfPersons)
noScreening.events<-
  unlist(sapply(1:v0$numberOfPersons,function(i){result$eventHistories[[i]]$noScreening$events}))
```

- and I discovered that its value was set to `1e6` (when it should now be `1e3`). I struggled to identify why this had occurred, but tried changing `1:v0$numberOfPersons` to `1:length(result$eventHistories)` (as these should just be the same thing). This resolved the issue!

I rebuilt the docker image and launched a container and ran the test, but it failed again, this time with the error -

```
Error in `x[[jj]][iseq] <- vjj`: replacement has length zero
Backtrace:
    ▆
 1. └─global Eventsandcosts(scen0.invite) at test-model.R:57:3
 2.   ├─base::`[<-`(`*tmp*`, i, "screening.prev", value = `<dbl>`) at functions/DES_Model.R:1695:9
 3.   └─base::`[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, i, "screening.prev", value = `<dbl>`) at functions/DES_Model.R:1695:9
```

Going to that line in `DES_Model.R`, I can see that the error is again related to `v0$numberOfPersons`:

```
Eventsandcosts.df[i,"screening.prev"]<-
          Eventsandcosts.df[i,"screening.n"]/v0$numberOfPersons
```

The value for `v0$numberOfPersons` is correct when printed from the test, but incorrect when running through the `Eventsandcosts()` function. The issue appears to be that `Eventsandcosts()` doesn't accept v0 as an input parameter, and instead uses it like a global parameter - but presumably, within a test, this is leading to issues.

I attempted a wrap around solution, which was to calculate the number of persons from `length(result$eventHistories)` and use that in place of all `v0$numberOfPersons`. I cleared my environment and re-ran the test: it appeared to work fine.

I rebuilt docker image and ran test in container - which passed!

To make sure this hadn't inadvertently affected my normal scenario scripts in anyway, I re-ran surveillance scenario 0, confirming the output `.csv` had not changed. Of note, the run time on that on my machine (rather than the high spec remote machine) was 21 minutes 59 seconds (whilst on remote it was 4 minutes 28 seconds). The main model output was the same, but the AAA-related death aaorta sizes did change. I'm not sure why one remained the same and one changed. I ran this again on the remote machine this time (`Rscript -e "source('models/NAAASP_COVID_modelling/run_aaamodel_surv_scen0.R')"`). And there was no change in the file! Given the motivations of this reproduction and stage we are at, I will not troubleshoot further on this issue.

### Final steps

**GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: Activated GitHub action to push Docker image to GitHub container registry. Pulled this, open RStudio, and ran test which passed.

**Run times**: This had largely been completed during reproduction, but I add times for the test, and the time from running surv scen 0 on a different machine (as above).

**Quarto site**: Finally, I modified the GitHub action. So far, it had set to not build `.Rmd` files (to avoid errors encountered due to R environment). However, as I would like to include the notebook in the final Quarto site, I then modified the action as I did in Huang et al. to not run with every push, and instead manually updated the site from my local macine using `quarto publish`. This is a temporary fix, as I have not been able to get a GitHub action working to render this on pushes automatically for me, for R. When doing so, have to remember to delete `_freeze/`, `_site/` and `.quarto` before running, to ensure it runs everything properly.
