# AAA Screening Discrete Event Simulation Model

This repository contains R scripts and code to run the discrete event simulation models for AAA screening. 


The following directories are included:

* /models      	-- R scripts that run the DES models for AAA screening

* /models/Example    -- An example script to run the DES is contained here

* /models/SWAN  -- Screening Women for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (SWAN) model scripts. See our [Lancet publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31222-4) and [HTA report](https://doi.org/10.3310/hta22430) for further details

* /models/NAAASP_COVID_modelling -- Scripts for modelling the impact of changes to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm screening and treatment services in England during the COVID-19 pandemic. See our [PLOS ONE](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253327) publication for further details 

* /functions   	-- Contains the DES model code

* /input 	     	-- Contains the input parameters and .csv files needed to run the DES models

* /input/SWAN	-- Screening Women for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (SWAN) input parameters. See our [Lancet publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31222-4) and [HTA report](https://doi.org/10.3310/hta22430) for further details
