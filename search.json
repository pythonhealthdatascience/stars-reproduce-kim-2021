Looking at that script, aortaDiameterThresholds are set as v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds &lt;- list(c(3.0, 4.5, 5.5)). Viewing the object rather than printing it with View(v1other), I can see that the thresholds are stored, but its just a list within a list.\nI tried commenting the print statement in run_aaamodel... but this just led to a later error for the same variable when it is used. As such, I instead altered assignment of this variable in the sourced script to c(3.0, 4.5, 5.5) (removing list()).\nThis then ran without issue. As it ran, I can see it sets a random seed (set.seed(3210)). As per usual, paused timing while it ran.\nSpent a long while on processPersons() (scen0.invite &lt;- processPersons(v0, v1other, v2, personData.screen)). At 13.48 (with model running since 13.13), I could see these would likely be slow models to run, so logged into the remote computer, cloned the GitHub repository there, and ran the next script starting at 13.55, run_aaamodel_65yo_scen0.R. To do so, after cloning, I ran:\ncd stars-reproduce-kim-2021/reproduction\nRscript -e \"renv::restore()\"\nRscript -e \"source('models/NAAASP_COVID_modelling/run_aaamodel_65yo_scen1.R')\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nIncluding the expected run time would be handy, as I assume this is working fine, but that’s working on the assumption that these models take a long time to run (which I’m not sure yet whether that is the case or not).\nIn this case, as I later found out they used HPC, it would’ve been beneficial to mention that also!\n\n\nI checked the run_aaamodel... scripts and realised that in each, none were using parallel processing (as v0$method &lt;- \"serial\").\nLooking at the DES_Model code I can see the example of processPersons() allows three possible inputs:\n\n“serial”\n“parallel” (which uses parallel)\n“foreach” (which uses doParallel)\n\nThe function psa() is the same, but also includes “parallelBatches” alongside “foreach”. However, the consequence of those inputs is to return an error that the method has not been implemented for psa. Hence, psa can only run with “serial” or “parallel”. Likewise for psaAboveDiagnosisThreshold().\nAt 14.16 (so having let the model run since 13.55, for 21 minutes), I cancelled the run on the remote computer, and altered the scenario script to set v0$method &lt;- \"parallel\". Then set that running, starting at 14.21. At this moment, the first scenario was still running on my machine (since 13.13, so for apx. 1h 10m now).\nAt 14.39, I noticed the parallel model said Killed. In case I might have accidentally done this, I just set it to rerun again. However, at 14.52, it showed as Killed again. Upon Googling, I can see this message occurs when you run out of memory - which perhaps, might be why all were set to run sequentially, if its too intensive to run in parallel. I switched it back to “serial”.\nHowever, the model still running on my machine has now been going for 1h 42m. Having looked in the repository and article for any indication of runtime or requirement of HPC, I’ve yet to find anything. I tried looking now at the article first describing the model (https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X17753380). In this article, they state the run time:\nHowever, the computational requirements of the DES were extensive, given the number of individuals needed to reduce sampling variation to an acceptable level and characterizing uncertainty through PSA. Run time was in the region of 24 h to run the model with 500,000 patients and 1,000 PSA iterations, even with parallelization and the use of a high-powered computer.\nIn this case, “each scenario model is run for 10 million hypothetical individuals randomly drawn with replacement from the distribution of the relevant population. The models are run for a period of 30 years”. However, as there is no mention of performing probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations in the article, we could expect this to be quicker than that (although note it is 10m patients instead of 500k).\nDiscussed with Tom and agreed to:\n\n\nTry and just run it with very few people, just so we can see if the model is working, and whether we could get similar results with fewer people in the model\n\n\nTry and run it sequentially on the remote computer overnight"

This finished almost immediately, then hit an error:\n&gt; TableOfCounts(scen0.invite, v1other)\nError in \"screen\" %in% eventHistory$events && !(\"nonvisualization\" %in%  : \n  'length = 3' in coercion to 'logical(1)'\nTableOfCounts() is from DES_Model.R. Working through each line of the function, I found that the error is occurring for scre_dropout=countDropouts(result, v1other).\nIn this function, personsInfo (result, ie. scen0.invite) is used. It loops through the EventHistories for each person: for (i in 1:length(personsInfo$eventHistories)). It checks whether their events:\n\nIncludes “screen” (\"screen\" %in% eventHistory$events)\nDoes not include “nonvisualization” (!(\"nonvisualization\" %in% eventHistory$events))\nIf the measured size for screen is greater than or equal to v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds[[1]]\n\nThe error occurs for that final comparison. That is the item we had to change earlier to be able to get the model to run. I tried setting that back to being a list within a list - v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds &lt;- list(c(3.0, 4.5, 5.5)). However, I realised that caused the issue, and that in fact, run_aaamodel_65yo_scen0.R is changing it to list() again before running the model:\n## Change v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds to be a list (new syntax)\nv1other$aortaDiameterThresholds &lt;- list(v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds)\nIf I comment out that line, an error occurs. Hence, it seems we require it to be in a list within a list for the model, but just a list for TableOfCounts(). Looking at all the repository code, the reason becomes apparent in models/NAASP_COVID_modelling/run_aaamodel_surv_scen3.R, when multiple aaortaDiameterThresholds are provided.\nAs such, I set about modifying the later processing functions so that they are able to use this list() format:\n\ninput/NAAASP_Men_2020-05-11/DES_Data_Input_NAAASP_Men_30years_time_horizon_2020-05-11.R: returned back to list(c()), but then changed run_aaamodel_65yo_scen0.R to not add an additional list() over the top.\nDES_Model.R: countDropouts(): &gt;= v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds[[1]] to &gt;= v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds[[1]][1]\n\nThe whole script then ran successfully!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nThese errors will likely be the result of having modified code but no re-run everything from scratch (unsurprising given the anticipated model run times)."

The last cut-point must always relate to the aortic size where surgery is to be considered (e.g. 5.5cm)”)\n\nLooking at the next R script, run_aaamodel_65yo_scen1.R, I can see that they repeat the model multiple times to get results from varying parameters of that scenario. That script is scenario 1 which, from Table 1, we can see delays invitation from 3 months to 5 years.\nI switched to trying that script, but again first setting:\n\n# v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds &lt;- list(v1other$aortaDiameterThresholds)\nv0$numberOfPersons &lt;- 1000\n\nThis ran eight “scenarios” within the script.

To calculate excess, given that the results appears to increment from the first 0 scenario, I’m assuming that this is the change in deaths from the 0 scenario.\nI created an .Rmd file to start processing the results. This required the addition of rmarkdown to the renv. I add dplyr for processing the results. Looking at excess deaths, we can see the anticipated pattern, although for emergency operations, the numbers are still too small that they fluctuate, and emergency operations goes in the wrong direction.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.read_csv('tab2.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndelayscr\nexcess_death\nexcess_op\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.00\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0.25\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n0.50\n2\n-1\n\n\n3\n1.00\n0\n-2\n\n\n4\n2.00\n2\n-2\n\n\n5\n3.00\n2\n-1\n\n\n6\n4.00\n5\n-1\n\n\n7\n5.00\n7\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried upping it to 100,000 people, and recorded the time with different settings:\n\n“serial” - 5 minutes 7 seconds\n“parallel” - 2 minutes 12 seconds (although 1m10 of that was just it getting set up it seems, as the line Random seed has been set by clusterSetRNGStream(iseed=3210).)\n“foreach” - not possible, Error in processPersons(v0, v1other, v2, personData.screen) : v0$randomSeed does not yet work with v0$method=\"foreach\"\n\nFor each of these, about 45 seconds is results processing at the end (e.g. Eventsandcosts())\nWhilst these ran, I looked through the repository to try and spot whether they had functions to generate the plots from the article.

Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\nThe “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\nException to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nConveying Modified Versions.\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\nunder this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nunder the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n\nObject Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\nGive prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nAccompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n\nCombined Works.\n\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\nGive prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nAccompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nFor a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nDo one of the following:\n\nConvey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\nUse a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\nProvide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n\nCombined Libraries.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\nAccompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nGive prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\nRevised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n\n\n\nThis is aligned with the original study, who shared their code under [license].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView license\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Embedded license]\n\n\n\n\nThe original study was published in the journal “[Journal name]”.
