<!-- TODO: Remove this warning once completed assessment -->
**Please note: This page is in-progress and has not yet been completed**

Of the 10 items in the scope, X% (X out of 10) were considered to be **successfully reproduced**.

As cited throughout, images on this page are sourced from @kim_modelling_2021

**Note:** This items have been reproduced with simulations containing 1,000,000 people (instead of 10,000,000) as that is very computationally expensive. We felt that, with 1,000,000 people, results are reasonably similar enough to be satisified with reproduction, whilst still being feasible to run on our machines.

## Time-to-completion

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time_to_complete import process_times, success_static, success_interactive

# List of time to complete each item
# TODO: Change to actual items and times for this project
time_list = [
    [445, 'Figure 1'],
    [511, 'Table 2'],
    [581, 'Figure 2'],
    [619, 'Figure 3'],
    [np.nan, 'In-text result 1'],
    [np.nan, 'Figure 4'],
    [np.nan, 'Figure 5'],
    [np.nan, 'Table 3'],
    [np.nan, 'Supplementary figure 3'],
    [np.nan, 'Supplementary table 2']]
times_df = process_times(time_list)
```

Non-interactive plot:

```{python}
success_static(times_df)
```

Interactive plot:

```{python}
success_interactive(times_df)
```

## In-text result 1

In bold are the items not captured in Table 3 or Figure 3:

"Suspending ultrasound scans in the surveillance cohort could result in 9 (0.4% increase) additional AAA-related deaths if scans were suspended for one year (Table 3, Fig 3). Of these, **2 (1% increase) are in the sub-group measuring 4.5–4.9 cm** at the start of the pandemic and **7 (8% increase) in the sub-group measuring 5.0–5.4 cm**; **<0.1 are in the 3.0–4.4 cm sub-group**. More pronounced effects are evident for suspension for two years and beyond. Suspending surveillance for two years could result in 40 excess AAA-related deaths overall; a 1.9% increase over the lifetime of the surveillance cohort. Of these, **1 is in the 3.0–4.4 cm sub-group and 17 (7% increase) in the 4.5–4.9cm sub-group**. However, the remaining **22 excess deaths are in the 5.0–5.4cm range, corresponding to a 24% increase** in AAA-related deaths in this sub-group."
