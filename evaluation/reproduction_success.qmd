<!-- TODO: Use skeleton to create page describing reproduction success. If it is subjective (e.g. comparing figures), be sure to explain how you decided that the figure was now successfully reproduced or not -->

Of the X items in the scope, X% (X out of X) were considered to be **successfully reproduced**.

## Time-to-completion

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time_to_complete import process_times, success_static, success_interactive

# List of time to complete each item
# TODO: Change to actual items and times for this project
time_list = [
    [100, 'In-text result 1'],
    [200, 'In-text result 2'],
    [400, 'Figure 2'], # Finished work, not completed, adjust to set to NaN
    [np.nan, 'Figure 3'],
    [np.nan, 'Figure 4'],
    [300, 'Figure 5'],
    [np.nan, 'Supplementary figure'],
    [np.nan, 'In-text result 3']]
times_df = process_times(time_list, adjust='Figure 2')
display(times_df)
```

Non-interactive plot:

```{python}
success_static(times_df)
```

Interactive plot:

```{python}
success_interactive(times_df)
```
