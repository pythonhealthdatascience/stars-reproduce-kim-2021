## In-text result 1

In bold are the items not captured in Table 3 or Figure 3.

"Suspending ultrasound scans in the surveillance cohort could result in 9 (0.4% increase) additional AAA-related deaths if scans were suspended for one year (Table 3, Fig 3). Of these, **2 (1% increase) are in the sub-group measuring 4.5–4.9 cm** at the start of the pandemic and **7 (8% increase) in the sub-group measuring 5.0–5.4 cm**; **<0.1 are in the 3.0–4.4 cm sub-group**. More pronounced effects are evident for suspension for two years and beyond. Suspending surveillance for two years could result in 40 excess AAA-related deaths overall; a 1.9% increase over the lifetime of the surveillance cohort. Of these, **1 is in the 3.0–4.4 cm sub-group and 17 (7% increase) in the 4.5–4.9cm sub-group**. However, the remaining **22 excess deaths are in the 5.0–5.4cm range, corresponding to a 24% increase** in AAA-related deaths in this sub-group."
