<!-- TODO: Remove this warning once completed assessment -->
**Please note: This is a template page and has not yet been completed**

This page evaluates the extent to which the original study meets the recommendations from the STARS framework for the sharing of code and associated materials from discrete-event simulation models (@monks_towards_2024).

Of the **8** essential STARS components:

<!-- TODO: Add counts from evaluation -->
* **X** were met fully (‚úÖ)
* **X** was met partially (üü°)
* **X** was not met (‚ùå)

Of the **5** optional STARS components:

<!-- TODO: Add counts from evaluation -->
* **X** was met fully (‚úÖ)
* **X** were not met (‚ùå)

<!-- TODO: Fill in the table. Options are ‚úÖ Fully, üü° Partially, or ‚ùå Not met -->
