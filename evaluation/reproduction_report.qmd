## Study

> Kim LG, Sweeting MJ, Armer M, Jacomelli J, Nasim A, Harrison SC. **Modelling the impact of changes to abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and treatment services in England during the COVID-19 pandemic**. *PLoS ONE* 16(6): e0253327 (2021). <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253327>.

This study adapts a previously developed DES model for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening of men in England. It aims to explore different approaches to resuming screening and surgical repair for AAA, as these survives were paused or substantially reduced during COVID-19 due to concerns about virus transmission.

## Computational reproducibility

Successfully reproduced **10 out of 10 (100%)** of items from the scope in **14h 42m (36.8%)**.

Required troubleshooting:

* **Reduce run time** - reducing population size and setting to parallel to reduce runtime to a feasible level
* **Fix error in script** - fixing a minor error from switching between nested and unnested lists to provide a parameter
* **Write code to implement scenarios and generate outputs** - write code to find the aaorta sizes of people with AAA-related deaths, as well as code to produce all of the tables and figures from the model output

## In-text result 1

Original:

"Suspending ultrasound scans in the surveillance cohort could result in 9 (0.4% increase) additional AAA-related deaths if scans were suspended for one year (Table 3, Fig 3). Of these, **2 (1% increase) are in the sub-group measuring 4.5–4.9 cm** at the start of the pandemic and **7 (8% increase) in the sub-group measuring 5.0–5.4 cm**; **<0.1 are in the 3.0–4.4 cm sub-group**. More pronounced effects are evident for suspension for two years and beyond. Suspending surveillance for two years could result in 40 excess AAA-related deaths overall; a 1.9% increase over the lifetime of the surveillance cohort. Of these, **1 is in the 3.0–4.4 cm sub-group and 17 (7% increase) in the 4.5–4.9cm sub-group**. However, the remaining **22 excess deaths are in the 5.0–5.4cm range, corresponding to a 24% increase** in AAA-related deaths in this sub-group."

<sup>Context: The original study repository was evaluated against criteria from journal badges relating to how open and reproducible the model is and against guidance for sharing artefacts from the STARS framework. The original study article and supplementary materials (excluding code) were evaluated against reporting guidelines for DES models: STRESS-DES, and guidelines adapted from ISPOR-SDM.</sup>
