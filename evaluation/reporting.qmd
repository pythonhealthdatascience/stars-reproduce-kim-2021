| Item | Recommendation | Met by study? | Evidence |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Objectives** | 
| 1.1 Purpose of the model | Explain the background and objectives for the model | ‚úÖ Fully | `Introduction` - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) "screening (including surveillance) in most areas of the UK was paused during the lockdown due to concerns about COVID-19 transmission"... this study uses a previously developed and validated model "to explore different approaches to post-lockdown service resumption"<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021 |
| 1.2 Model outputs | Define all quantitative performance measures that are reported, using equations where necessary.  Specify how and when they are calculated during the model run along with how any measures of error such as confidence intervals are calculated. | ‚úÖ Fully | `Methods: Post-COVID-19 policy scenarios` - "Total numbers of AAA- related deaths, operations (both elective and emergency) and ruptures over the whole follow- up period are recorded for each model. These clinical results are reported as percentage change from the status quo as well as expected increase in number of events when scaled to the popu- lation of England"<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021 |
| 1.3 Experimentation aims | If the model has been used for experimentation, state the objectives that it was used to investigate.<br>(A) Scenario based analysis ‚Äì Provide a name and description for each scenario, providing a rationale for the choice of scenarios and ensure that item 2.3 (below) is completed.<br>(B) Design of experiments ‚Äì Provide details of the overall design of the experiments with reference to performance measures and their parameters (provide further details in data below).<br>(C) Simulation Optimisation ‚Äì (if appropriate) Provide full details of what is to be optimised, the parameters that were included and the algorithm(s) that was be used.  Where possible provide a citation of the algorithm(s). | ‚úÖ Fully  | Primary scenarios clearly described in `Table 1`.<br><br>![Table 1](../original_study/tab1.PNG){.lightbox}<br><br>Supplementary scenarios not described as clearly, but can be easily understood from supplementary table 2, regardless.<br><br>![Supplementary table 2](../original_study/sup_tab2.png){.lightbox}<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021 |
| **Logic** |
| 2.1 Base model overview diagram | Describe the base model using appropriate diagrams and description.  This could include one or more process flow, activity cycle or equivalent diagrams sufficient to describe the model to readers.  Avoid complicated diagrams in the main text.  The goal is to describe the breadth and depth of the model with respect to the system being studied. | **TBC** | Not provided in this study, but states in `Methods: Model` that this is a model that "has previously been developed" and "the full pathway reflecting both the natural history and screening programme is described in detailed elsewhere". It cites [Glover et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X17753380) and [Thompson et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.3310/hta22430). Glover et al. 2018 includes a flow diagram (Figure 1). |
| 2.2 Base model logic | Give details of the base model logic. Give additional model logic details sufficient to communicate to the reader how the model works. | **TBC** | `Methods: Model` does mention that this is described elsewhere, but "in brief... the original DES model simulated events for a new cohort at a given age (e.g. 65) from the time of invitation to screening up to their date of death or age 95 (the time horizon). The repurposed DES model is extended here to allow events to be simulated from a cohort of individuals already under surveillance in the NAAASP, through simulation of key characteristics (age and aortic diameter) at the inception of the model (‚Äútime zero‚Äù), which is taken to be March 2020 when the initial UK national ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù was imposed". It cites [Glover et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X17753380) which provides a very detailed description of the base model logic.<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021  |
| 2.3 Scenario logic | Give details of the logical difference between the base case model and scenarios (if any).  This could be incorporated as text or where differences are substantial could be incorporated in the same manner as 2.2. | ‚úÖ Fully | Described in the text, and main scenarios clearly presented in `Table 1`.<br><br>![Table 1](../original_study/tab1.PNG){.lightbox}<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021 |
| 2.4 Algorithms | Provide further detail on any algorithms in the model that (for example) mimic complex or manual processes in the real world (i.e.  scheduling of arrivals/ appointments/ operations/ maintenance, operation of a conveyor system, machine breakdowns, etc.). Sufficient detail should be included (or referred to in other published work) for the algorithms to be reproducible.  Pseudo-code may be used to describe an algorithm. | **TBC** | Not provided in this study, but states in `Methods: Model` that this is a model that has previously been developed, with the cited [Glover et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X17753380) providing some (but not all) of the sampling distributions used... "The DES involves a large number of parameters. These can be classified into several sets: global fixed parameters, global uncertain parameters, and parameters that are specific to an individual or a pair of twins (‚Äúglobal‚Äù refers to population parameters and ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù means that a parameter follows a random distribution). Like the functions, these sets form a hierarchy. For example, in a PSA, a beta distribution is used to generate the probability that an individual will die following emergency surgery, if they have emergency surgery. The parameters of the beta distribution are global fixed parameters, and the probability is a global uncertain parameter. In the main analysis, when a pair of twins is created, the probability is used as the parameter in a Bernoulli distribution to generate the indicator for the twins‚Äô emergency surgery outcomes. The indicator is a variable specific to the pair of twins."<br><br>@glover_discrete_2018 |
| 2.5.1 Components - entities | Give details of all entities within the simulation including a description of their role in the model and a description of all their attributes. | ‚úÖ Fully | `Methods: Model` - "The original DES model simulated events for a new cohort at a given age (e.g. 65) from the time of invitation to screening up to their date of death or age 95 (the time horizon). The repurposed DES model is extended here to allow events to be simulated from a cohort of indi- viduals already under surveillance in the NAAASP, through simulation of key characteristics (age and aortic diameter) at the inception of the model (‚Äútime zero‚Äù), which is taken to be March 2020 when the initial UK national ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù was imposed."<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021 |
| 2.5.2 Components - activities | Describe the activities that entities engage in within the model. Provide details of entity routing into and out of the activity. | **TBC** | Not described in this paper, but cites @glover_discrete_2018 as providing further details. In their paper, they detail activities in the `Methods` or show them within Figure 1. |
| 2.5.3 Components - resources | List all the resources included within the model and which activities make use of them. | **TBC** | - |
| 2.5.4 Components - queues | Give details of the assumed queuing discipline used in the model (e.g. First in First Out, Last in First Out, prioritisation, etc.). Where one or more queues have a different discipline from the rest, provide a list of queues, indicating the queuing discipline used for each.  If reneging, balking or jockeying occur, etc., provide details of the rules. Detail any delays or capacity constraints on the queues. | **TBC** | - |
| 2.5.5 Components - entry/exit points | Give details of the model boundaries i.e. all arrival and exit points of entities.  Detail the arrival mechanism (e.g. ‚Äòthinning‚Äô to mimic a non-homogenous Poisson process or balking) | ‚úÖ Fully | `Methods: Model` - entities are followed "at a given age (e.g. 65) from the time of invitation to screening up to their date of death or age 95 (time horizon)"<br><br>@kim_modelling_2021 |

For terminating systems state the stopping condition.<br>State what if any initial model conditions have been included, e.g., pre-loaded queues and activities.  Report whether initialisation of these variables is deterministic or stochastic. | **TBC** | Not mentioned in this paper, but prior paper mentions that events "occur as a continuous process over time" (i.e. non-terminating). @glover_discrete_2018. I did not feel I could clearly identify, from either paper, whether a warm-up or initialisation conditions were used. |

| 4.3 Estimation approach | State the method used to account for the stochasticity: For example, two common methods are multiple replications or batch means. Where multiple replications have been used, state the number of replications and for batch means, indicate the batch length and whether the batch means procedure is standard, spaced or overlapping. For both procedures provide a justification for the methods used and the number of replications/size of batches. | ‚úÖ Fully | `Methods: Post-COVID-19 policy scenarios` - "Each scenario model is run for 10 million hypothetical individuals...

| 5.3 Model execution | State the event processing mechanism used e.g. three phase, event, activity, process interaction.<br>*Note that in some commercial software the event processing mechanism may not be published. In these cases authors should adhere to item 5.1 software recommendations.*<br>State all priority rules included if entities/activities compete for resources.<br>If the model is parallel, distributed and/or use grid or cloud computing, etc., state and preferably reference the technology used.  For parallel and distributed simulations the time management algorithms used.  If the HLA is used then state the version of the standard, which run-time infrastructure (and version), and any supporting documents (FOMs, etc.) | **TBC** | Didn't feel I could find the event processing mechanism. The prior study does mention though that the code is "written to run in parallel".<br><br>@glover_discrete_2018 |
| 5.4 System specification | State the model run time and specification of hardware used.  This is particularly important for large scale models that require substantial computing power.  For parallel, distributed and/or use grid or cloud computing, etc. state the details of all systems used in the implementation (processors, network, etc.) | **TBC** | Not mentioned in this study, but prior study mentions that "run time was in the region of 24 h to run the model with 500,000 patients and 1,000 PSA iterations, even with parallelization and the use of a high-powered compute".<br><br>@glover_discrete_2018 | 
| **Code access** |
