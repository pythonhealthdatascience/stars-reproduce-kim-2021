title: "Process model results to generate results in article"
author: "Amy Heather"

This script assumes you have already run the scenarios in `models/` and saved those results to `.csv` files which we here then process to generate the results from the paper.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
y65_s1 <- read.csv("../output/output_65yo_scen1.csv")
y65_s1
```

```{r}
tab2 <- res %>%
  mutate(excess_death = aaadead - first(aaadead),
         excess_op = emeropen - first(emeropen)) %>%
  select(delayscr, excess_death, excess_op) %>%
  arrange(delayscr)

write.csv(tab2, "../../logbook/posts/2024_07_29/tab2.csv", row.names=FALSE)

tab2
```
